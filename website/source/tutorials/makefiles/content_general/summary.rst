Summary
=======

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a ``Makefile`` which can be used to automate various tasks.

.. hint::

    - We have shown how to create dependencies between tasks and how to visualize them in plain text and in a graph.
    - we also shown how to create self documenting Makefile which allows eaasier to understand tasks what are available and how to run them.

If you are interested in learning more about Makefiles, you can check the resources in next section.
