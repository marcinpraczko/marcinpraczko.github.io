Self documented Makefile
========================

Introduction
------------

Self documented Makefile is a ``Makefile`` which contains comments with description of tasks.
This is very useful when one have a lot of tasks and one wants to understand what each task is doing.
Also this works well when one want to group tasks together based on some criteria.
