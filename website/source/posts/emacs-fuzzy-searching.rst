Introduction
------------

Fuzzy searching is a powerful feature that allows you to search for text in a buffer

Configuration
-------------

To enable fuzzy searching in Emacs, you need to install the ``ivy`` and ``swiper`` package.
You can do this by running the following commands from emacs:

.. code-block:: text

    M-x package-install RET ivy RET
    M-x package-install RET swiper RET

Please also add the following configuration to your ``init.el`` file:

.. code-block:: lisp

    (ivy-mode)
    (require 'swiper)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'swiper)

Reload your configuration by running ``M-x eval-buffer``.

After you've added the configuration, you can use the ``C-s`` keybinding to start a fuzzy search in the current buffer.


Screenshot

In the displayed screenshot, the word ``Task`` is searched for in the buffer. Notice how the search results are highlighted in the buffer.

- After pressing ``C-s``, the search prompt appears at the bottom of the buffer.
- As you type, the search results are updated in real-time.
